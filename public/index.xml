      <description>I’ve now been working in the Newcastle Data Science hub for a little over a month and I wanted to blog some personal reflections, in part for me to look back on my experience of moving in to a more digital role and for analysts considering getting in to data science but would like some insight in to the change they may experience.
Having spent 2 and a half years working on publishing national statistics (whether in the form of bulletins or data on Stat-Xplore), it was time for me to try something new.</description>

 Introduction From the 12-14th September I attended the Use of R in Official Statistics (uRos) conference at The Hague, which 32 countries were represented at! I learnt so much over the 3 days, and meeting government statisticians from across the world who loved R was a really enriching experience.</description>

      <description>Originally from an ecology background, now a government statistician.
My predominate coding language is R, but I’m hoping always looking to expand my technical knowledge, especially with open source software.
I am particularly interested in how government can best use its data to inform citizens and improve services and can talk about these subjects for eons.
On a more personal note, I’m a born and bred Londoner now living in Newcastle Upon Tyne.</description>
