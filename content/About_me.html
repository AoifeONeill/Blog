<p>Originally from an ecology background, now a government statistician.</p>
<p>My predominate coding language is R, but I’m hoping always looking to expand my technical knowledge, especially with open source software.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in how government can best use its data to inform citizens and improve services and can talk about these subjects for eons.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I’m a born and bred Londoner now living in Newcastle Upon Tyne. I love cats and am ultimately a people person. Geeky interests outside of Data Science and stats includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comics (or reading anything)- mostly Marvel, never DC</li>
<li>Bird identification</li>
<li>Quilting</li>
</ul>
