Originally from an ecology background, now a government statistician. 

My predominate coding language is R, but I'm hoping always looking to expand my technical knowledge, especially with open source software.

I am particularly interested in how government can best use its data to inform citizens and improve services and can talk about these subjects for eons.


On a more personal note, I'm a born and bred Londoner now living in Newcastle Upon Tyne. I love cats and am ultimately a people person. Geeky interests outside of Data Science and stats includes:

* Comics (or reading anything)- mostly Marvel, never DC
* Bird identification
* Quilting
